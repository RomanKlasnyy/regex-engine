# regex_engine

This project is made for simulating the RegEx. It is a good challenge and a chance to get to know the basics of RegEx by trying to reimplement it's features as a project.
There is a *3 months difference* between the half-done regex (which is what I call shaghetti code) and the finished version of regex, which uses OOP principles.
